# AI Policy Statement

Cataclysm: The Last Generation does not include any LLM/AI-generated code or content, and will
accept no submissions which do. "AI" content like this is usually pieced together from works
which were not released for this sort of reuse, and even if they were, as LLMs can provide no
provenance for anything they generate, it is impossible for this material to be in compliance with
our CC BY-SA 3.0, which states that anything used for the project must be credited to its original
creator.

The above applies to EVERYTHING in the repo, including documentation, code, json, tilesets, music, and sound.
