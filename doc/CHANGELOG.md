# Changes in The Last Generation

Cataclysm: The Last Generation bases off Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. As such, the changes are compared to it.

## Major changes

> [!CAUTION]
> There is no intended compatibility with Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead saves and mods.
> While simple mods *may* continue to work, if they break, you get to keep both pieces.
> There is absolutely no support for trying to make DDA saves work.

- Removal of imgui
  - imgui is, as of writing, still very unstable in Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead and causes a major amount of breakage. This is why we got rid of it here.
- Less mods
  - Due to incompatibility, most major mods have been removed. This includes Magiclysm, Mind over Matter and Xedra Evolved. Innawood and Sky Island are staying though.
  - `no_npc_needs` and `personal_portal_storms` have been removed. The former is default now, the latter got removed together with portal storms.
  - It is safe to edit `mods.json` in your save to remove the two mods above if you played a pre-1.0 version of Cataclysm: The Last Generation.
- CBMs return to labs
- Exodii have been removed. Personally, I appreciated the writing of DDA's Exodii, but found them to be a bad fit for the game as they take the focus off of procedural world exploration and shift it to repeated visits to the same static NPC. They also run counter to our theme, which is more backyard sci fi and conspiracy and less alien invasion.
- Portal storms have been removed. While an interesting idea, these were designed to throw a lot of threats at you that are simply best avoided. The fact that every storm included every type of threat meant they all got old fast, and they too frequently interrupted more interesting gameplay. There are plans to add supernatural weather effects which are more varied and less intrusive to stand in for the reality-bending nature of the Cataclysm.
- Police bots return
- Apocalyptic regional settings. The Cataclysm was a slow process that took decades to build up before exploding into a zombie apocalypse. In that time, supply lines eroded, the climate shifted, crops failed, and plant life began to die while people and animals slowly began mutating. The natural world is no longer pristine, and the weather is much harsher.
- Less free food. Food was running out a year before the dead began to walk. Panic-buying, hoarding, and infighting made it difficult for governments to get supplies to their people. Homes are no longer totally stocked with all the food you could ever want.
- Foraging is much more difficult. Fruit-bearing plants are harder to come by, and finding ones that aren't picked over or totally bare is hard work that requires a bit of survival and perception.
- Skill rust has been removed. This was never a good mechanic. DDA's attempts to revive it were met with widespread resistance, and it was then nerfed to become a "bonus" that hardly counted for anything at all. Cataclysm games do not last long enough to model any sort of realistic skill rust, and constantly losing skills is not a fun experience, so the whole system is gone.
- 
- Acid additions
  - Acid can damage items now
  - Acid will also poison you
- Foraging is significantly harder
- You can grab and throw enemies

## Minor changes

- Being small or tiny means decreased HP
- The steel variants have been removed. No more tempered, mild, etc steel. It is all one kind of steel now.
- Survivor suits have returned
