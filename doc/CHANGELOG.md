# Changes in The Last Generation

Cataclysm: The Last Generation bases off Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. As such, the changes are compared to it.

## Major changes

- Removal of imgui
  - imgui is, as of writing, still very unstable in Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead and causes a major amount of breakage. This is why we got rid of it here.
- Less mods
  - Due to incompatibility, most major mods have been removed. This includes Magiclysm, Mind over Matter and Xedra Evolved. Innawood and Sky Island are staying though.
- CBMs return to labs
- Exodii have been removed
- No more portal storms
- Police bots return
- The world is more dead
- Skill rust has been removed
- Acid additions
  - Acid can damage items now
  - Acid will also poison you
- Foraging is significantly harder
- You can grab and throw enemies

## Minor changes

- Being small or tiny means decreased HP
- The steel variants have been removed. No more tempered, mild, etc steel. It is all one kind of steel now.
